# Cartesi Rollups Skill Management Application

This project demonstrates a skill management application using Cartesi Rollups for handling and processing skill offers and requests. The application utilizes Ethereum-related functionality through the `ethers` library to manage skills offered and requested by users.

## Overview

- **Backend Requirements:** The backend must use Cartesi Rollups APIs.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - Node.js
  - npm
  - ethers.js library
  - Cartesi Cli
  - Cartesi Rollups APIs
  - Docker Desktop

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and run:
   npm install

3. **Install Docker Desktop:**
    Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running. You can download it from docker.com.

4. **install Cartesi cli**

5. **Install Cartesi SDK**
    Install Cartesi SDK globally if not already installed:
    npm install -g @cartesi/rollups

 ### Environment Variables:
Set the ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL environment variable to the URL of your Cartesi Rollups server. You can create a .env file in your project root with the following content:

ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL=https://your-rollup-server-url

## Build the Rollup:
Use Cartesi SDK to build your rollup:
**cartesi build**

## Run the Rollup:
Start the rollup using Cartesi SDK:
**cartesi run** 

## Endpoints
The DApp interacts with a rollup server and provides the following endpoints:

**POST /finish**
Description: Polls for the status of pending rollup requests.
Request Body:

{
  "status": "accept"
}

**POST /report**
Description: Sends a report to the rollup server.
Request Body:


{
  "payload": "hex_encoded_string"
}

**POST /notice**
Description: Sends a notice to the rollup server.
Request Body:

{
  "payload": "hex_encoded_string"
}

## Handling Requests
advance_state
Description: Handles requests to offer or request skills.
Payload Format:

{
  "action": "offer" or "request",
  "skill": "skill_name"
}
**Responses**:
"accept": Skill action recorded successfully.
"reject": Invalid skill name or action type.
inspect_state
Description: Handles requests to inspect the state of skills.

**Payload Format**:
"offered_skills": Returns a list of all skills offered by users.
"requested_skills": Returns a list of all skills requested by users.
"skills_by_user:<user>": Returns the skills offered and requested by a specific user.

**Responses**:
JSON object containing the relevant skill data.
"route not implemented": If the route is not recognized.
## Testing
**Simulate Requests**
Use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the rollup server endpoints and verify the DAppâ€™s behavior. Make sure to send requests to the correct endpoints with appropriate payloads.

## Notes
Ensure your backend implementation is compatible with Cartesi Rollups APIs.
The application periodically polls the Cartesi Rollups server and processes requests accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
No Pending Rollup Requests: The application retries if there are no pending requests.
Error Handling: Errors during request processing are logged for debugging.
